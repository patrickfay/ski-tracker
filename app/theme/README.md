# Theme

This directory will hold SASS files for global styling for the application (buttons, panels, mixins, etc.).

All styles from `theme.scss` will be interpreted to css and stored in `../app.style.css`  
`theme.scss` will only contain imported scss files. These imported files must be properly ordered.

Overall structure and needs will be determined when overall project hierarchy and functionality is determined.
