# Services

This directory holds all of the services needed for this application.

Services in this directory are used for global functionality (such as uploading/downloading json data). If you are looking for a service specific to a component, that service's file will likely be found within that component's directory.

**NOTE** - will likely need to add object models for objects here (will also have to update main README file in 'Entry' section that points where to find object models)
