# Services

This directory holds all of the services needed globally for this application. Some services will also be used to store global application data since we do not utilize external servers to store user and other application data.

**NOTE** - Services within this directory are used for global functionality. If you are looking for a service specific to a component, that service's file will likely be found within that component's directory.
