# Views

This directory will hold the different views for this app. The views will basically be the main different components needed for this app. Should be straight forward but here's a few possibilites for now:

* data page (holding all ski days)
* functionality page (describing whats good with this app and feats)
* others?

## Components Files

Each component will contain 3 files:

* HTML file
  * Contains the template for the component
  * This can be omitted if the template is simple enough for an inline template
* JS file
  * Contains the logic for this component
* SCSS file
  * Contains any custom styling this component needs
  * This file can be omitted if no custom styling is needed

**NOTE** - These components should be simple and short files. These components will be comprised of different modules, which will hold more complex and reusable components.
