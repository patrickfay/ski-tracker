# Modules

This directory holds all modules needed for this application.  

**PLEASE NOTE** that these modules are **not** used in the same way as the components found within the `/components` directory. These modules are **NOT GLOBAL**, meaning these modules are used for specific functionalities of the application (ie. for an **entry**).

Each module contains resuable logic and templates for a specific functionality. Each module can be comprised of **components** and **services** needed for a reusable module.
