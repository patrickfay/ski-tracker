# Modules

This directory will hold all of the modules needed for this application.  
Each module will contain resuable logic and templates for a specific functionality. Each module will be a component and will be comprised of three files:

* HTML file
  * Contains the template for the component
  * This can be omitted if the template is simple enough for an inline template
* JS file
  * Contains the logic for this component
* SCSS file
  * Contains any custom styling this component needs
  * This file can be omitted if no custom styling is needed
